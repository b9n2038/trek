# Get better on mini-projects
> Trial a process to improve my shaping and shipping of mini-projects.

Mini project in this sense is a smallish piece of work, like a small react project with some data store, local or deployed in cloud.

## Problem and history: 
So often I get project ideas and spend more time thinking about them then actually doing producing something. Or I produce something that always requires a few more tweaks to get it going again. Maybe I'm a procrastinator or maybe I just over think the wrong things, burn up my mental energy and give up.
Or maybe I've just been doing this too long and remember the pain of some types of work, maybe that builds up anxiety or reluctance to take certain approaches.

- When I dive in and get started, I might get stuck somehow, slip down some rabbit hole
  - or analysis, paralysis
  - then I lose any momentum and motivation so there is nothing finished, nothing to show.
- As projects are naturally complex, maybe I've developed a habit to avoid thinking about how to think and communicate it and just want to be left alone to mull it over but that lacks the professional approach I'd like to provide.

- I've tried numerous things in the past. Done heaps of reading etc. I've tried tracking time, technology areas etc....
- But I just feel I've plateaued and that is a very unpleasant to feel for long periods of time.
- My natural bias, is drawn towards the backend technical pieces, instead of the front-end and usability

Q: What changes can I make to improve my process that I can actually follow through with?

## Top Outcomes
1. Regularly deliver finished mini-projects. 
   - *let this become a habit*
   - *then do it in one sitting*
2. Document knowledge and language of how to think about leveraging different libraries and key decisions.
3. Do the painful things more often.
4. Build confidence of time estimates.
  
## Trial process:
1. Identify the problem/opportunity. What outcomes and what is the output. How long do I want to spend on it, consider RICE priority or is it just fun.
2. Shaping the solution. Check in with the 37signals shaping and shipping. Keep dropping scope till it is small enough to finish in an afternoon
3. List the **milestones** - *small, list*
   1. pick which one you'll be happy considering it is done
   2. breakdown into **tasks**
4. keep a **Time Log**
   1. at some time interval, indicate some kind of status (traffic light?), comment on what you are up to and what is slowing you down.
   2. what status makes sense? like roadblock, detour
   3. if using pomodoro then in between pomodoros
5. log a list of **Pains**
6. track **Errors** list
   1. what errors in decision making are being made
   2. look at the cleaning book for inspiration

## The doing

Allow 30-45mins to setup a mini-project.
shaping: diagram on paper: project repo 
milestones: project repo
setup a new repo
add a shipping.md
include headings
   - problem
   - milestones
   - pain
   - errors
   - timelog

add folder/sittings
